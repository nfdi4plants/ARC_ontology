# ARC ontology 
###### (latest update 25.01.2023)

In this repository the ARC container ontology will be maintained in .owl format (16.09.2022). At the moment the ARC.owl ontology contains the ISA-JSON model structure. The structure is compliant with the ARCcommander JSON output file (07.09.2022) that was generated from the example ARC [samplearc_rnaseq](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/brilator/samplearc_rnaseq). Visualization of the ontology is possible with the web service [webVOWL](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/).

## WIP
* provide an .obo compliant ontology file
* include CWL related information on runs and workflows

## **Attention!**
It is strongly advised to reuse the ontology in .owl format only and not in .obo or .ttl format as a conversion will result in information loss due to the different semantics.
