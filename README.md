# ARC_ontology

In this repository the ARC container ontology will be maintained in .owl format (16.09.2022). At the moment the ARC.owl ontology contains the ISA-JSON model structure. The structure is compliant with the ARCcommander JSON output file (07.09.2022). 

All cwl-related information (runs & workflows) are currently wip. 

## **Attention!**
It is strongly advised to reuse the ontology in .owl format only and not in .obo or .ttl format as a conversion will result in information loss due to the different semantics.
